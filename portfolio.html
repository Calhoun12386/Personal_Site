                Installing and setting up the new Emmegi M4 machine in our shop was a detailed process. First, I cleared
                and prepared the designated area, ensuring it met the machine's requirements for space and ventilation.
                Following the manufacturer's instructions meticulously, I positioned the machine in place and securely
                anchored it to the floor to prevent any vibrations during operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, I meticulously installed and connected the various components, such electricity, pneumatics and
                the control panel, ensuring each part was correctly integrated. Once installed, I meticulously
                calibrated
                the machine's settings to align with our production needs, conducting several test runs to verify its
                accuracy and performance. Finally, after thorough testing and safety checks, the Emmegi M4 was ready for
                seamless integration into our workshop's operations.

            <img src="images/pivot.jpg" alt="door_pivot">
            <p>
                Designing a program to machine butt hinges for our shop's new door program involved a meticulous
                approach. Initially, I analyzed the specifications of the door style to determine the precise dimensions
                and specifications required for the hinges.
            </p>
            <p>Leveraging CAM-Plus software, I crafted a detailed digital
                model of the hinges, ensuring compatibility with the door design and functional requirements.

            </p>
            <p>
                Next, I programmed the machining parameters into our CNC machine, configuring the cutting tools and feed
                rates for optimal performance. fine-tuning the toolpaths to achieve
                precise cuts and angles. Through rigorous testing and iteration, I optimized the program for efficiency
                and accuracy, enabling seamless production of consistent and high-quality butt hinges for our doors.

            <h2>Project Three</h2>
            <p>
                Undertaking the project to re-fabricate incorrectly manufactured vents was a meticulous endeavor. First,
                the vents had to be carefully disassembled to their individual components. Using precise measurements,
                the components were then cut down to the correct size to fit the rough openings in the building.
            </p>
            <p>
                After ensuring accurate adjustments, the vents were meticulously reassembled, paying close attention to
                alignment and structural integrity. Through meticulous planning and execution, the vents were
                successfully refurbished to meet the required specifications, resolving the initial manufacturing
                discrepancy.
